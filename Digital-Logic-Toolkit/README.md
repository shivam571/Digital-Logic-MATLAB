# Digital Logic Design & Analysis Toolkit using MATLAB

## Objective
To design and simulate basic digital logic circuits using MATLAB
for better understanding of Digital Electronics and VLSI fundamentals.

## Modules Implemented
- Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT)
- Truth Table Generator
- Half Adder
- Full Adder
- 2-Variable Karnaugh Map Simplification
- Verilog RTL: Logic Gates, Half Adder, Full Adder




## Tools Used
- MATLAB (Onramp concepts)
## HDL Support
This project includes basic Verilog RTL implementations to demonstrate
the transition from algorithm-level simulation (MATLAB) to hardware
description languages used in VLSI design.


## Applications
- Digital circuit design
- VLSI RTL foundation
- Educational visualization

## Future Scope
- Full Adder
- K-map simplification
- Verilog implementation
