## Verilog RTL Modules

This folder contains basic RTL implementations of digital logic circuits
written in Verilog HDL.

### Modules
- Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT)
- Half Adder
- Full Adder

### Purpose
To bridge MATLAB-based functional simulation with RTL-level digital design,
useful for VLSI and FPGA fundamentals.
